Priority: High
Status: In Progress
Effort: 8 story points
Sprint: Sprint 10
Due: 2024-01-15

**Notifications**:
- üîÑ Direct message to new assignee
- üîÑ Handoff notification to previous assignee
- üìã Team channel update
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manager notification if workload concerns

**Example Messages**:
```
üîÑ @john.doe you've been reassigned PROJ-123: Implement user authentication
Previous assignee: @jane.smith
Priority: High
‚ö†Ô∏è Workload Alert: You now have 9 active tickets
Recommendations:
‚Ä¢ Consider deferring non-critical tasks
‚Ä¢ Review sprint commitments
üîó View in JIRA
```

### 3. Unassignment
**Trigger**: Ticket becomes unassigned
**Notifications**:
- ‚ùì Team channel notification requesting volunteer
- üìã Project manager notification if high priority

**Example Message**:
```
‚ùì PROJ-123 is now unassigned and needs an owner
Title: Implement user authentication
Priority: High
Who can take this ticket?
üîó View in JIRA
```

### 4. Workload Warning
**Trigger**: Assignment would cause workload concerns
**Notifications**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced assignee notification with recommendations
- üö® Manager notification for critical overload
- üìä Team visibility for capacity planning

**Example Message**:
```
üö® Workload Concern: PROJ-123 assignment
Assignee: @john.doe
Current workload: 12 tickets, 45 story points
Risk level: CRITICAL

Recommendations:
‚Ä¢ Immediate workload redistribution needed
‚Ä¢ Consider reassigning lower-priority tickets
‚Ä¢ Schedule urgent discussion with team lead
üîó View in JIRA
```

## Workload Risk Assessment

### Risk Calculation Factors

1. **Ticket Count**: Number of active tickets assigned
2. **Story Points**: Total story points in progress
3. **High Priority Count**: Number of high/critical priority tickets
4. **Overdue Count**: Number of overdue tickets
5. **Capacity Utilization**: Percentage of maximum capacity used

### Risk Levels

#### üü¢ Low Risk (Score: 0-2)
- Normal workload within capacity
- No immediate concerns
- Standard notifications only

#### üü° Moderate Risk (Score: 3-4)
- Approaching capacity limits
- Monitor workload closely
- Include capacity info in notifications

#### üü† High Risk (Score: 5-7)
- Over capacity or high utilization
- Workload warnings generated
- Manager notifications triggered
- Recommendations provided

#### üî¥ Critical Risk (Score: 8+)
- Severe overload detected
- Immediate intervention needed
- Escalated notifications
- Urgent recommendations

### Workload Recommendations

The system generates contextual recommendations based on risk factors:

- **Critical Overload**: Immediate workload redistribution, reassign tickets, urgent team discussion
- **High Utilization**: Monitor closely, defer non-critical tasks, review commitments
- **Overdue Tickets**: Immediate attention needed, prioritization review
- **High Priority Conflicts**: Review prioritization, consider resource allocation
- **Sprint Over-capacity**: Review sprint commitments, adjust scope
