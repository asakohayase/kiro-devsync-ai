# Agent Hook Architecture and Development Patterns

## Overview

Agent hooks are event-driven components that provide automated responses to development workflow events. This document establishes architectural standards for implementing, managing, and extending agent hooks within the DevSync AI project.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Base Hook Implementation
All agent hooks must extend the base `AgentHook` class from `devsync_ai.core.agent_hooks`:

```python
from devsync_ai.core.agent_hooks import AgentHook, EnrichedEvent, HookExecutionResult

class CustomHook(AgentHook):
    async def execute(self, event: EnrichedEvent) -> HookExecutionResult:
        # Implementation here
        pass
    
    def should_execute(self, event: EnrichedEvent) -> bool:
        # Filtering logic here
        return True
```

### Event Classification System
Use the standardized event categories and urgency levels:

- **EventCategory**: `STATUS_CHANGE`, `ASSIGNMENT`, `COMMENT`, `PRIORITY_CHANGE`, `BLOCKER`, `CREATION`, `TRANSITION`
- **UrgencyLevel**: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`
- **SignificanceLevel**: `MINOR`, `MODERATE`, `MAJOR`, `CRITICAL`

### Hook Registration Pattern
Register hooks through the `HookRegistryManager`:

```python
from devsync_ai.hooks.hook_registry_manager import default_hook_registry

# Register hook for specific event types
default_hook_registry.register_hook("jira.issue.updated", CustomHook())
```

## Implementation Standards

### Error Handling Requirements
- Use `HookErrorHandler` for consistent error processing
- Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
- Log errors with structured context for debugging
- Return appropriate `HookExecutionResult` status codes

### Async Processing Patterns
- All hook execution must be async to prevent blocking
- Use `HookLifecycleManager` for execution context management
- Implement proper timeout handling (default: 30 seconds)
- Support cancellation for long-running operations

### Configuration Management
- Store hook configurations in YAML format under `config/`
- Use `HookConfigurationManager` for runtime configuration
- Validate configurations with `HookConfigurationValidator`
- Support environment variable overrides for sensitive data

### Template Integration
- Use the template system for message formatting
- Leverage `HookTemplateIntegration` for consistent messaging
- Support both Slack Block Kit and plain text formats
- Implement fallback templates through `HookTemplateFallback`

## Data Flow Architecture

### Standard Processing Pipeline
```
Webhook Event → Event Processor → Hook Dispatcher → Specific Hook → Notification System
```

### Event Enrichment
Events are enriched with additional context before hook execution:
- User information and permissions
- Project and sprint metadata
- Historical data and trends
- Workload and capacity analysis

### Notification Integration
- Use `HookNotificationIntegration` for consistent messaging
- Support multiple notification channels (Slack, email, etc.)
- Implement message batching for efficiency
- Apply deduplication to prevent spam

## Analytics and Monitoring

### Hook Performance Tracking
- All hooks are automatically monitored by `HookAnalyticsEngine`
- Track execution time, success rates, and error patterns
- Generate performance reports and optimization recommendations
- Monitor resource usage and capacity planning

### Business Metrics Integration
- Hooks contribute to business metrics through `BusinessMetricsEngine`
- Track productivity impact and workflow efficiency
- Analyze team workload distribution
- Generate insights for process improvement

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing Standards
- Test hook logic in isolation using mocked events
- Verify error handling and edge cases
- Test configuration validation and loading
- Use the `HookTestSuite` framework for consistency

### Integration Testing
- Test complete event processing pipelines
- Verify notification delivery and formatting
- Test hook interactions and dependencies
- Use realistic webhook payloads for testing

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- Validate webhook signatures for security
- Implement proper access control for hook configurations
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Support role-based hook execution permissions

### Data Sanitization
- Sanitize all user input from external systems
- Validate webhook payloads before processing
- Implement proper escaping for message templates
- Log security events for audit trails

## Performance Optimization

### Execution Efficiency
- Use async/await patterns throughout
- Implement proper connection pooling for external APIs
- Cache frequently accessed data (user info, project metadata)
- Batch operations when possible to reduce API calls

### Resource Management
- Set appropriate timeouts for hook execution
- Implement circuit breakers for external service failures
- Monitor memory usage for large webhook payloads
- Use database connections efficiently

## Extension Patterns

### Custom Hook Development
1. Extend the base `AgentHook` class
2. Implement required abstract methods
3. Register with appropriate event types
4. Add configuration schema if needed
5. Include comprehensive tests

### Hook Composition
- Combine multiple hooks for complex workflows
- Use hook dependencies for ordered execution
- Implement conditional hook chains
- Support dynamic hook registration based on configuration

### Plugin Architecture
- Support external hook plugins through discovery
- Implement proper isolation for third-party hooks
- Provide plugin API documentation and examples
- Maintain backward compatibility for plugin interfaces
