# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automated Agent Hooks that respond to JIRA webhook events and trigger intelligent Slack notifications. The system creates event-driven automation that integrates with the existing enhanced notification system and JIRA integration to provide seamless, intelligent workflow automation using Kiro's Agent Hook capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want automated Slack notifications when JIRA tickets change status, so that I stay informed about project progress without manually checking JIRA.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JIRA ticket status changes THEN the system SHALL trigger an Agent Hook that processes the event
2. WHEN the Agent Hook processes a status change event THEN it SHALL generate a formatted Slack notification using the existing SlackMessageFormatterFactory
3. WHEN a status change notification is generated THEN it SHALL include ticket details, old status, new status, and assignee information
4. IF the status change indicates a blocker THEN the system SHALL use high-priority notification formatting
5. WHEN the notification is ready THEN it SHALL be sent through the existing enhanced notification system

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to receive notifications when tickets are assigned to team members, so that I can track workload distribution and provide support when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JIRA ticket is assigned to a user THEN the system SHALL trigger an assignment Agent Hook
2. WHEN the assignment hook processes the event THEN it SHALL identify the assignee and relevant team channels
3. WHEN generating assignment notifications THEN the system SHALL include ticket priority, description summary, and assignee details
4. IF the assignee is overloaded based on current ticket count THEN the system SHALL include workload warnings in the notification
5. WHEN the assignment notification is complete THEN it SHALL be routed to appropriate team channels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want notifications when high-priority tickets receive comments, so that I can stay engaged with critical issues without monitoring JIRA constantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a comment is added to a JIRA ticket THEN the system SHALL evaluate the ticket priority and comment content
2. IF the ticket priority is high or critical THEN the system SHALL trigger a comment notification Agent Hook
3. WHEN processing comment events THEN the system SHALL extract comment author, content preview, and ticket context
4. WHEN generating comment notifications THEN the system SHALL format them using appropriate templates from the existing template system
5. IF the comment contains keywords indicating blockers or urgent issues THEN the system SHALL escalate the notification priority

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a development team, I want configurable hook rules per team, so that different teams can receive relevant notifications based on their specific workflows and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Agent Hooks THEN teams SHALL be able to define custom rules for different JIRA event types
2. WHEN team configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL validate rule syntax and event type compatibility
3. WHEN processing JIRA events THEN the system SHALL apply team-specific filtering rules before triggering notifications
4. IF multiple teams are affected by a single JIRA event THEN the system SHALL generate team-specific notifications based on their individual configurations
5. WHEN rule conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL use default fallback behavior and log the conflict for review

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and analytics for Agent Hook performance, so that I can optimize the system and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Agent Hooks execute THEN the system SHALL log execution time, success/failure status, and event details
2. WHEN hooks fail THEN the system SHALL capture error details, retry attempts, and failure reasons
3. WHEN generating analytics THEN the system SHALL track hook trigger frequency, processing times, and notification delivery rates
4. IF hook performance degrades THEN the system SHALL generate alerts for administrators
5. WHEN viewing hook analytics THEN administrators SHALL have access to dashboards showing hook health and performance metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Agent Hook system to integrate seamlessly with existing JIRA and notification components, so that the solution leverages current infrastructure without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Agent Hooks THEN the system SHALL use the existing JIRA service integration for webhook processing
2. WHEN formatting notifications THEN the system SHALL utilize the existing SlackMessageFormatterFactory and template system
3. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL route through the existing enhanced notification system components
4. IF existing components need extension THEN the system SHALL extend rather than replace current functionality
5. WHEN integrating with current systems THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing notification workflows

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a team member, I want different hook types for different JIRA events, so that I receive appropriately formatted and prioritized notifications based on the type of change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining Agent Hooks THEN the system SHALL support distinct hook types for status changes, assignments, comments, and priority updates
2. WHEN a JIRA event occurs THEN the system SHALL route to the appropriate hook type based on the event payload
3. WHEN processing different event types THEN each hook type SHALL use specialized formatting and routing logic
4. IF an event matches multiple hook types THEN the system SHALL process all applicable hooks without duplication
5. WHEN hook types are configured THEN the system SHALL validate that each type has appropriate templates and routing rules

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a development team, I want error handling and retry mechanisms for Agent Hooks, so that temporary failures don't result in lost notifications or system instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Agent Hook execution fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL log the failure and optionally send fallback notifications
3. WHEN webhook payloads are malformed THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize data before processing
4. IF the Slack API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue notifications for later delivery
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed error logs for debugging and system health monitoring
