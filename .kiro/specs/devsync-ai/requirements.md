# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DevSync AI is a smart release coordination tool that automates communication and coordination tasks within software teams by connecting GitHub, JIRA, and Slack. The tool helps teams stay aligned by generating automatic updates, identifying blockers, and producing weekly changelogs through Kiro's automation capabilities. It serves as a central hub for development activity tracking, bottleneck identification, and automated team communication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to automatically track GitHub pull requests and their status, so that I can quickly understand the current state of development without manually checking each repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created or updated THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and record the PR status
2. WHEN queried THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all open PRs with merge readiness status
3. WHEN merge conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL identify and report conflict status for each affected PR
4. WHEN a PR is ready for review THEN the system SHALL flag it as review-ready in the summary

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to sync with JIRA to monitor ticket progress and detect blockers, so that I can proactively address issues before they impact sprint goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JIRA tickets are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically sync the latest status and progress
2. WHEN a ticket remains in the same status for an extended period THEN the system SHALL flag it as a potential blocker
3. WHEN sprint updates occur THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in ticket assignments and priorities
4. WHEN blockers are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and impact

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to receive automated Slack updates with daily stand-up summaries and real-time development activity, so that I stay informed without constantly monitoring multiple tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN daily stand-up time arrives THEN the system SHALL generate and send a summary of yesterday's progress and today's planned work
2. WHEN significant development activity occurs THEN the system SHALL send real-time notifications to relevant Slack channels
3. WHEN team members are mentioned in PRs or issues THEN the system SHALL notify them via Slack
4. WHEN critical blockers are identified THEN the system SHALL immediately alert the team through Slack

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want automatically generated weekly changelogs based on commit messages, PRs, and issue activity, so that I can communicate releases to stakeholders without manual compilation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a week ends THEN the system SHALL automatically compile a changelog from the week's activity
2. WHEN generating changelogs THEN the system SHALL categorize changes by type (features, bug fixes, improvements)
3. WHEN commit messages follow conventional formats THEN the system SHALL parse and organize them appropriately
4. WHEN PRs are merged THEN the system SHALL include relevant PR descriptions and linked issues in the changelog

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to identify bottlenecks, inactivity, and duplicated efforts within the team, so that I can optimize team productivity and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing team activity THEN the system SHALL identify patterns indicating bottlenecks in the development process
2. WHEN team members show prolonged inactivity THEN the system SHALL flag potential capacity or engagement issues
3. WHEN similar work is being done by multiple team members THEN the system SHALL detect and report potential duplication
4. WHEN productivity metrics decline THEN the system SHALL provide insights into possible causes and recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to securely store summaries and logs in Supabase, so that historical data is preserved and accessible for analysis and reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is collected from external APIs THEN the system SHALL securely store it in Supabase with proper encryption
2. WHEN storing sensitive information THEN the system SHALL follow data privacy and security best practices
3. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide efficient querying and retrieval capabilities
4. WHEN data retention policies apply THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or delete old data as configured

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide a RESTful API through FastAPI, so that I can integrate DevSync AI with other tools and customize its functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL respond with properly formatted JSON data
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate API keys or tokens before processing requests
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
