# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring and reorganizing the devsync_ai codebase to improve maintainability, reduce technical debt, and establish better project structure. The current codebase has grown organically and needs systematic cleanup to support future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN all test files SHALL be located in a dedicated `tests/` directory
2. WHEN looking for configuration files THEN they SHALL be organized in appropriate directories with clear naming conventions
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no orphaned or misplaced files in the root directory
4. WHEN navigating the project THEN the directory structure SHALL follow Python packaging best practices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate code duplication and reduce file complexity, so that the codebase is easier to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing service files THEN no single file SHALL exceed 500 lines of code
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN duplicate code patterns SHALL be extracted into reusable utilities
3. WHEN looking at TODO/FIXME comments THEN they SHALL be either resolved or converted to proper issues
4. WHEN reviewing API clients THEN they SHALL use appropriate abstraction levels without unnecessary complexity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of concerns between API endpoints and webhook handlers, so that each module has a single responsibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining API routes THEN they SHALL only contain REST API endpoints, not webhook handlers
2. WHEN reviewing webhook handlers THEN the working GitHub webhook implementation SHALL be moved from api/routes.py to webhooks/routes.py
3. WHEN looking at route organization THEN the TODO webhook stubs in webhooks/routes.py SHALL be replaced with the working implementations
4. WHEN examining webhook routing THEN there SHALL be no duplicate webhook endpoints between the two route files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve working functionality while cleaning up unused code, so that refactoring doesn't break the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining Slack integration THEN unused Slack template files SHALL be removed since no Slack service exists
2. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN TODO endpoints that aren't implemented SHALL be clearly marked or removed
3. WHEN looking at the working GitHubâ†’JIRA webhook flow THEN it SHALL be preserved during refactoring
4. WHEN examining service dependencies THEN only actually used services SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of concerns between production code and development tooling, so that I can distinguish between app functionality and development utilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing development tools THEN MCP configurations SHALL be clearly separated from production dependencies
2. WHEN looking at external service clients THEN they SHALL be lightweight and focused on production needs
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN development scripts and production code SHALL be clearly separated
4. WHEN reviewing the 1400+ line jira.py file THEN it SHALL be broken down into smaller, focused modules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and logging consistency, so that debugging and monitoring are more effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in service integrations THEN they SHALL be handled consistently across all modules
2. WHEN reviewing logging statements THEN they SHALL follow a consistent format and level structure
3. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN service calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want better configuration management, so that environment-specific settings are handled cleanly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN configuration SHALL be managed through environment variables
2. WHEN reviewing configuration files THEN sensitive data SHALL not be hardcoded
3. WHEN examining service configurations THEN they SHALL be validated at startup
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL handle missing or invalid values gracefully
