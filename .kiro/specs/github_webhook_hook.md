# GitHub Webhook Agent Hook Specification

## Overview
Create a FastAPI-based GitHub webhook agent hook that automatically processes GitHub events and sends Slack notifications using our existing Slack integration.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- FastAPI application with webhook endpoint `/webhooks/github`
- Process GitHub webhook payloads for pull request events
- Extract relevant PR data (title, author, action, URL, branch, reviewers)
- Integrate with existing SlackClient to send notifications
- Support multiple PR actions: opened, closed, merged, ready_for_review, synchronize
- Include comprehensive logging and error handling

### Webhook Processing
Handle these GitHub webhook events:
1. **pull_request.opened** - New PR created
2. **pull_request.closed** - PR closed (check if merged)
3. **pull_request.ready_for_review** - Draft PR ready for review
4. **pull_request.synchronize** - New commits pushed to PR

### Data Extraction
Extract from GitHub webhook payload:
- PR title and description
- Author information (login, avatar)
- Action type and timestamp
- Branch names (head and base)
- PR URL and number
- Reviewer assignments
- Labels and milestone info
- Merge status and conflict detection

### Slack Integration
- Use existing SlackClient and message templates
- Route different events to appropriate templates
- Include action buttons for PR management
- Add threading support for PR updates
- Handle notification failures gracefully

### Security & Validation
- Validate GitHub webhook signatures (optional for development)
- Sanitize incoming payload data
- Rate limiting protection
- Error boundary handling
- Request logging for debugging

### API Structure
- POST /webhooks/github - Main webhook endpoint
- GET /health - Health check endpoint
- GET /status - Service status and metrics
- Include proper HTTP status codes and responses

## Implementation Notes
- Use FastAPI with async/await for performance
- Include request/response models with Pydantic
- Comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Environment variable configuration
- Startup/shutdown event handlers
- CORS configuration for development
