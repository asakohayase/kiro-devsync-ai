# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Notification Logic feature adds intelligent notification processing capabilities to DevSync AI, transforming it from a simple notification relay system into a smart, context-aware notification management platform. This system will reduce notification noise, improve team productivity, and ensure critical information reaches the right people at the right time through intelligent filtering, batching, scheduling, and routing mechanisms.

The system integrates seamlessly with existing slack-message-templates and leverages the GitHub/JIRA data processing infrastructure already implemented, enhancing rather than replacing the current notification workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Notification Filtering

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want the system to intelligently filter notifications so that I only receive relevant, actionable information without being overwhelmed by noise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is received THEN the system SHALL analyze the content, context, and recipient relevance before deciding whether to send it
2. WHEN duplicate or similar notifications are detected within a configurable time window THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single notification
3. WHEN a notification matches user-defined noise patterns (e.g., automated bot comments, minor status changes) THEN the system SHALL suppress or downgrade the notification priority
4. WHEN a notification involves the recipient directly (mentions, assignments, reviews) THEN the system SHALL always allow it through with high priority
5. WHEN filtering rules are applied THEN the system SHALL log the decision rationale for audit and tuning purposes
6. WHEN a notification is filtered out THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism for users to review filtered notifications if needed

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Message Batching

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want related notifications to be batched together so that my team receives consolidated updates rather than a stream of individual messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple related notifications occur within a configurable time window THEN the system SHALL group them into a single batched message
2. WHEN notifications share common attributes (same PR, same project, same author) THEN the system SHALL identify them as batchable
3. WHEN a batch reaches a maximum size or time threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically send the batched notification
4. WHEN urgent notifications are received THEN the system SHALL send them immediately without waiting for batching
5. WHEN a batch is created THEN the system SHALL use appropriate message templates that clearly present the grouped information
6. WHEN batching is configured per channel THEN the system SHALL respect channel-specific batching preferences

### Requirement 3: Work Hours Timing Controls

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive notifications during my work hours and have non-urgent notifications scheduled for appropriate times so that I'm not disturbed outside of work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is generated outside of configured work hours THEN the system SHALL queue it for delivery during the next work period
2. WHEN urgent notifications (critical alerts, security issues) are received THEN the system SHALL deliver them immediately regardless of work hours
3. WHEN work hours are configured per user or team THEN the system SHALL respect individual and team-level time preferences
4. WHEN multiple time zones are involved THEN the system SHALL handle timezone conversions correctly for each recipient
5. WHEN scheduled notifications accumulate THEN the system SHALL provide a morning digest of overnight activities
6. WHEN work hours change (holidays, PTO, schedule updates) THEN the system SHALL adapt the delivery schedule accordingly

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Channel Routing

**User Story:** As a team member, I want notifications to be automatically routed to the most appropriate channel based on content type, urgency, and team structure so that information reaches the right audience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is processed THEN the system SHALL analyze content type, urgency level, and team involvement to determine optimal channel routing
2. WHEN critical security or production issues are detected THEN the system SHALL route notifications to designated alert channels
3. WHEN PR reviews are requested THEN the system SHALL route notifications to appropriate development channels and directly to reviewers
4. WHEN JIRA tickets are updated THEN the system SHALL route notifications based on project, component, and team assignments
5. WHEN channel routing rules are configured THEN the system SHALL allow customization of routing logic per team and content type
6. WHEN routing decisions are made THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into why specific channels were chosen

### Requirement 5: Duplicate Prevention System

**User Story:** As a Slack user, I want to avoid receiving duplicate notifications for the same event so that my channels remain clean and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a unique hash based on content, source, and context
2. WHEN a duplicate hash is detected within a configurable time window THEN the system SHALL prevent the duplicate notification from being sent
3. WHEN notification content is updated (e.g., PR description changes) THEN the system SHALL recognize it as a new notification rather than a duplicate
4. WHEN duplicate detection occurs THEN the system SHALL update the original notification with additional context if appropriate
5. WHEN hash collisions are possible THEN the system SHALL use sufficiently robust hashing to minimize false positives
6. WHEN duplicate prevention is bypassed (manual override) THEN the system SHALL log the override reason and allow the notification

### Requirement 6: Background Processing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want notifications to be processed asynchronously in the background so that the system remains responsive and can handle high volumes of notifications efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are received THEN the system SHALL queue them for background processing without blocking the source system
2. WHEN background processing occurs THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully with retry mechanisms and dead letter queues
3. WHEN scheduled notifications are due THEN the system SHALL process them reliably even after system restarts
4. WHEN processing queues become backlogged THEN the system SHALL prioritize urgent notifications and provide monitoring capabilities
5. WHEN background jobs fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logging and alerting for system administrators
6. WHEN system maintenance occurs THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle job processing during deployments and updates

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a DevSync AI user, I want the enhanced notification logic to work seamlessly with existing slack-message-templates and GitHub/JIRA processing so that I get improved functionality without losing current capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing notification workflows are enhanced THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with current message templates
2. WHEN GitHub webhook events are processed THEN the system SHALL apply intelligent filtering and routing before using existing PR/issue templates
3. WHEN JIRA webhook events are processed THEN the system SHALL enhance the existing JIRA notification workflow with smart batching and scheduling
4. WHEN message templates are used THEN the system SHALL support both individual and batched message formats
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL allow gradual rollout and A/B testing of new notification logic
6. WHEN integration issues occur THEN the system SHALL fallback to existing notification behavior to ensure reliability

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a team administrator, I want to configure notification behavior, filtering rules, and routing logic to match my team's specific workflow and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring notification settings THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive interfaces for setting up filtering rules, batching preferences, and routing logic
2. WHEN teams have different workflows THEN the system SHALL support team-specific, channel-specific, and user-specific configuration overrides

4. WHEN rules conflict THEN the system SHALL provide clear precedence ordering and conflict resolution
5. WHEN configurations are complex THEN the system SHALL provide templates and presets for common team setups
6. WHEN settings need to be audited THEN the system SHALL maintain configuration history and change logs

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want visibility into notification patterns, filtering effectiveness, and team engagement so that I can optimize our notification strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are processed THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on volume, filtering decisions, delivery timing, and user engagement
