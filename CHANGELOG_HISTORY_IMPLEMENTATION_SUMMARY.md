## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Intelligent Storage System
```python
# Automatic version management
result = await manager.store_changelog(changelog)
# Returns: version 2 if updating existing week's changelog

# Comprehensive audit trails
audit_entry = {
    'changelog_id': changelog.id,
    'action': 'CREATE',
    'user_id': user_id,
    'timestamp': datetime.utcnow(),
    'details': {'version': changelog.version}
}
```

### 2. Advanced Search and Filtering
```python
# Multi-criteria filtering
filters = HistoryFilters(
    team_ids=['engineering', 'product'],
    date_range=(start_date, end_date),
    status=ChangelogStatus.PUBLISHED,
    search_text='authentication',
    tags=['security', 'feature'],
    created_by='alice'
)
results = await manager.retrieve_changelog_history(filters)
```

### 3. Intelligent Trend Analysis
```python
# Comprehensive trend analysis
trend_analysis = await manager.analyze_changelog_trends(team_id, period)
# Returns:
# - Metrics: publication rates, content analysis
# - Patterns: weekly consistency, seasonal trends
# - Predictions: next week forecasts
# - Anomalies: publication gaps, unusual patterns
```

### 4. Multi-Format Export System
```python
# Flexible export configuration
export_config = ExportConfig(
    format=ExportFormat.JSON,
    filters=HistoryFilters(team_ids=['engineering']),
    include_metadata=True,
    compress=True,
    schedule='weekly'
)
result = await manager.export_changelog_data(export_config)
```

### 5. Automated Data Retention
```python
# Compliance-aware retention policies
retention_policy = RetentionPolicy(
    team_id='engineering',
    archive_after_days=180,
    delete_after_days=2555,  # 7 years for compliance
    legal_hold=False,
    compliance_requirements=['GDPR', 'SOX']
)
result = await manager.manage_data_retention(retention_policy)
```
